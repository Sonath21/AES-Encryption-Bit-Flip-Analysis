# AES-Encryption-Bit-Flip-Analysis
This project provides a Python implementation to analyze the impact of bit flips on AES-encrypted messages. It supports encryption using AES in both ECB and CBC modes, introduces random bit flips in the messages, and calculates the Hamming distances between the original and flipped encrypted messages.
